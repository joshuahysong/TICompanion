# Twilight Imperium Companion

This project aims to be a companion web app for the epic tabletop game Twilight Imperium 3rd edition. Players will be able to track their unit stats, technologies, and simulate battles to gauge odds of winning engagements.

The current build in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/joshuahysong/TICompanion/tree/gh-pages) branch is published at the following url: http://www.joshuahysong.com/TICompanion/

## Build
